This folder has all the files which all are related to the implementation of Vector Space Model.

The folder is arranged in the following way and it has the following files:

	1. model
		- setup.py	
		- vsm.py  
        - processing.py
		- processing_word.py
		- test_input.xml
	2. output
		- unsupervised_rank_marimuthu_ananthavelu.txt
	3. report
		- Report - Question-Comment Similarity_4 Study Points.docx

Running the Software:

Running through Command line;

1. Go to the folder model
2. run python setup.py

Running through any other IDE;

1. Locate the folder path for a given IDE
2. Open setup.py
3. Run

model/setup.py is the main python implementation which acts as the source code and connects with other implementation files such as:

model/vsm.py - Which has the Vector Space Model implementation class

model/processing.py - which has the functions to preprocess the texts (Questions and comments)

model/processing_word.py - which has the functions to process the words which all are common between the question and all comments

Other enclosures:

1. report/Report - Question-Comment Similarity_4 Study Points.docx - Detailed report in implementing the Vector Space Model for Question and Comment similarity.

2.output file for the 'test_input.xml' - unsupervised_rank_marimuthu_ananthavelu.txt

3.model/test_sets/subset_train_1 - This set is created from the given training set to validate the accuracy of implementation in a small scale and expanding to the whole dataset.
